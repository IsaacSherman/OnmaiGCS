This repo is to supplement the World Anvil world of Onmai Salemot(https://www.worldanvil.com/w/onmai-salemot-raligan), providing cloud access to data files used in GCS (GURPS Character Creator available at https://gurpscharactersheet.com/) as well as collaboration possibilities and potentially issue tracking.  GCS is an extremely useful tool and I wish I had it back when I was playing GURPS in person- it makes building a character a really easy.   
To get started using this:
First, download and install GCS from the link above.  Install it and figure out where your user library is (on Windows it's at C:\Users\\*Your User Name*\GCS\User Library\
The best way is to install github for Windows or whatever platform you use: https://github.com/ will have all the info you'll need to get started with it. There you can also set up Github accounts which will be useful later.  I recommend the GUI version because it will allow you to manage your local copy without using a command line.  Use the tool to create your local files, this is called pulling, since you are pulling a copy from my master to your disk.  When you make changes, you are said to be pushing them.  
For now, you just want to pull my master repository to your local disk.  Set it up to use the User Library noted above.  This will ensure the files are accessible from within GCS.
>As of current writing, it can be a little iffy on updating the tree within GCS- you may need to make a change at the lowest level of the User Library to force a refresh or simply restart GCS to see updates.  This is a known issue with GCS on Windows and a fix should be out soon.
Now you should be able to run GCS.  Either open your character or create a new one in the file menu.  Then build your character with GCS's great interface.  But we aren't done.  We'll talk about making characters via discord.  Once you're done, you can export to a format Fantasy Grounds will understand.  Use Export To->Master Library Output Templates-> Fantasy Grounds PC, and select the local folder for our campaign (**TODO: Add instructions for finding this**).  Keep the naming consistent. 
GCS is where you'll update your character.  Every time we go to play, you'll need to export your character into FG- it's a pretty painless process.

GCS is a little daunting at first, but the files you'll be interested in are the Master Library -> Basic Set -> Basic Set Advantages/Equipment/Modifiers/Skills, along with the User Library->Onmai->*s
